# eXOtended-V2
An intended remake of the game eXOtended I coded back in high school, except with hopefully better coding skills

Currently, `src/` contains the source code for my eXOtended Discord bot coded with discord.js. I wrote this in TypeScript, because I plan to maybe someday in the future, make it into a website (likely in the same repo too). In that case, having some code I already wrote would help.

Documentation Upcoming Soon
